    <string id="AFlirtatiousEncounter_Event_Choice_4A" text="You cannot help but be a little annoyed as you'd rather drink in peace. When she gets over to you she introduces herself as {name}.

A few hours later as you are about to leave you come across {name} again. You tell her that you're sorry for what you said and you didn't mean it as you just wanted to be left alone.

    <string id="AFlirtatiousEncounter_Event_Choice_4B" text="Your irritation is palpable, preferring solitude over company. When she arrives, she introduces herself as {name}.

    <string id="AFlirtatiousEncounter_Event_Choice_4C" text="Feeling annoyed, you wish to savor your drink in solitude. As she approaches, she greets you as {name}.

Later, as you prepare to leave, you bump into {name} once more. You express regret for your earlier words, clarifying that your intention was simply to be left alone. In an unexpectedly gracious manner, she firmly rejects your apology, instructing you to go away with a refined yet clear directive." />
    <string id="AFlirtatiousEncounter_Event_Choice_4D" text="Annoyance bubbles within you, as you'd much rather drink undisturbed. She comes over and introduces herself as {name}. Your curt remarks soon send her away, potentially hurting her. Despite this, you achieve your goal of a solitary evening. Several hours later, you cross paths with {name} again while leaving. Offering an apology, you admit that your rude comments were a misguided effort to be left alone. Remarkably, she responds with a polite but unmistakable rejection, effectively telling you to back off in the nicest possible way." />
    <string id="AFlirtatiousEncounter_Event_Choice_4E" text="A sense of annoyance lingers, as you prefer to enjoy your drink alone. When she introduces herself as {name}, you don't take long to offend her, leading her to leave you in peace. Although this may have upset her, it grants you the solitude you desired. Later, at the end of the night, you encounter {name} again. Apologetically, you explain that your unkind words were just a misguided attempt to have some quiet time. She, in turn, manages to convey a polite yet unequivocal dismissal, cleverly telling you to go away without a hint of rudeness." />

The guards, showing visible reluctance and discomfort, comply with your order. One of them hoists the lifeless body over their shoulder. As you step out of the alley, a sense of exhilaration from your actions courses through you, mixed with a sense of power and control." />
    <string id="BeggarBegging_Event_Choice_5D" text="With a manipulative charm, you lure {genderAssignmentObjective} with the lucrative offer of 150 gold coins. Despite {genderAssignmentSubjective}'s initial mistrust, the prospect of such wealth proves too tempting, and {genderAssignmentSubjectiveCap} cautiously follows you. You lead {genderAssignmentObjective} to an obscure alley, far from prying eyes, where you swiftly turn violent. You strike the beggar with a powerful blow that sends {genderAssignmentObjective} crashing to the ground. As {genderAssignmentSubjectiveCap} tries to shield {genderAssignmentObjective}self, you continue your assault with an unbridled ferocity. The beggar's feeble attempts to protect {genderAssignmentObjective}self are no match for your ruthless aggression. After several minutes of continuous abuse, the beggar lies still, life extinguished by your relentless onslaught. As you exit the alley, a group of five guards confronts you, inquiring about the disturbance. You openly admit to your actions, declaring your distaste for beggars and commanding the guards to dispose of the body. Despite their apparent unease, the guards comply with your order, one of them shouldering the responsibility of carrying the deceased. You leave the alley, a complex mix of exhilaration and power washing over you, your actions leaving an indelible mark on your psyche." />
    <string id="BeggarBegging_Event_Choice_5E" text="With a blend of cunning and generosity, you deceive {genderAssignmentObjective} with an offer of 150 gold, convincing {genderAssignmentSubjective} to follow you. {genderAssignmentSubjectiveCap} cautiously agrees, lured by the promise of the gold. You take {genderAssignmentObjective} to a remote alley, ensuring no witnesses are present. Once isolated, you unleash a brutal assault on the beggar, delivering a crushing punch that sends {genderAssignmentObjective} reeling to the ground. {genderAssignmentSubjectiveCap} tries in vain to defend {genderAssignmentObjective}self as you continue your merciless beating. The beggar's struggles gradually cease as your blows continue unabated. When the violence ends, {genderAssignmentSubjective} lies lifeless on the alley floor. As you step out, you're met by a group of five guards who question your actions. Unabashedly, you confess to the murder, explaining your intention to rid the town of beggars. You then command the guards to remove the body, asserting your authority. The guards, visibly disturbed, follow your orders. One of them solemnly lifts the lifeless body, carrying it away. As you walk away from the alley, you feel an intense rush of power and dominance, the act of taking a life leaving a profound and dark impact on you." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 1-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1A" text="You ask for the name and rank of the man who died. When she tells you his name you do remember him and how he died. The soldier in question was executed by your hands as it was discovered he was a traitor. The question you ask yourself now is if his entire family should suffer from his mistake. They have spoken so warmly about him that you don't want to tell them the truth about how he died so you make up a heroic story. Even though the family have no right for compensation, you agree to pay them {familyCompensation} gold in compensation so they can keep their family farm. After you have handed over the gold to them and they have left, you cannot help but wonder if you did the right thing keeping the mother in the dark about her son's true nature. You end up drinking the night away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1B" text="You inquire about the name and rank of the deceased soldier. Upon hearing his name, you recall him vividly – he was executed by your order for treason. Now, you're faced with a moral dilemma: should his family suffer for his betrayal? They speak of him with such fondness that you decide against revealing the bitter truth, instead, crafting a tale of his bravery. Though they aren't entitled to compensation, you choose to give them {familyCompensation} gold to support their farm. As they depart with the gold, you're left questioning whether keeping the mother uninformed of her son's betrayal was the right choice. The rest of your night is spent in contemplative drinking, pondering over the complexities of truth and compassion." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1C" text="You request the name and details of the soldier who lost his life. Recognizing the name, you remember his fate - he was a traitor whom you had to execute. This revelation leaves you in a quandary; does his family deserve to bear the consequences of his actions? They hold him in such high regard that you choose not to shatter their image of him, instead telling a story of his heroism. Though they have no legal claim to compensation, you feel compelled to offer them {familyCompensation} gold to save their farm. After they leave with the money, doubts linger about your decision to keep the truth hidden, leading you to seek solace in drink as you reflect on the night's events." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1D" text="You question the woman about her husband's identity and his role in your army. When she mentions his name, it strikes a chord – he was the soldier you had executed for committing treason. This knowledge presents a difficult choice: should his family suffer for his wrongdoing? Realizing they hold him in high esteem, you decide to spare them the painful truth, inventing a story of his gallantry instead. Although there's no obligation for compensation, you hand them {familyCompensation} gold to help maintain their farm. After they've gone, you're left with a heavy heart, wondering if keeping the mother oblivious to her son's real actions was just. The night passes in a blur as you drink away your uncertainties." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1E" text="Curiously, you ask about the soldier's identity. When she reveals his name, memories flood back – he was the one you had to execute for his treacherous acts. This recollection forces you to confront a tough decision: is it fair for his family to pay for his mistake? Given their affectionate memories of him, you opt not to disclose the harsh reality, instead weaving a narrative of his valor. Despite no entitlement to compensation, you feel morally obliged to provide them {familyCompensation} gold for their farm's upkeep. Once they leave with the gold, a sense of doubt creeps in about your choice to conceal the truth from his mother, leading you to drown these thoughts in alcohol as the night progresses." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 2-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2A" text="You ask for the name and rank of the man who died. When she tells you his name you do remember him and how he died. The soldier in question was executed by your hands as it was discovered he was a traitor. You tell the family that you cannot grant them compensation as it was specified in his contract that the family left behind had no right to claim compensation. The woman starts to cry and begs you to help them. You decline to help them and leave the tavern." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2B" text="You inquire about the fallen soldier's name and rank. Recognition dawns as his name is mentioned, along with the memory of his execution - a traitor's end by your own hand. You inform the family that compensation is not possible, as his military contract clearly stated no entitlement for his family in such circumstances. The woman breaks down in tears, pleading for your assistance. Despite her pleas, you firmly uphold the decision and exit the tavern, leaving the family to grapple with the harsh realities of their situation." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2C" text="Seeking details, you ask about the soldier's identity. His name triggers memories; he was the one you executed for betrayal. You explain to the family that, according to his service terms, they are ineligible for compensation. Overwhelmed with sorrow, the woman starts to weep and implores you for aid. However, bound by the rules of the contract, you choose not to intervene and make your way out of the tavern, leaving them in their moment of despair." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2D" text="You question the family about the soldier's name and service rank. Upon hearing his name, you recall his fate – a traitor executed under your command. You relay to the family that, as per his agreement, they have no right to compensation. The woman's tears start to flow as she desperately seeks your help. Despite her distress, you maintain your stance, unable to deviate from the contract's stipulations, and depart from the tavern, leaving the family in their sorrowful state." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2E" text="Curious, you ask for the soldier's identity. His name brings back the memory of his execution for treachery. You inform the family that, under the terms of his enlistment, they are not entitled to any compensation. The woman, stricken with grief, begins to cry and earnestly requests your help. Despite her emotional plea, you stand by the contract's terms, declining to provide assistance, and take your leave from the tavern, immersed in the complexity of duty and compassion." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 3-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3A" text="Feeling drained and unwilling to engage in such a heavy conversation, you bluntly inform the family that you have no obligation to provide them with any assistance. The weight of their gaze lingers on you as you stand up, signaling your desire to leave the tavern. Their faces, etched with disappointment and growing despair, fade into the background as you step out, seeking to distance yourself from the situation. As you exit, the air of the tavern suddenly feels heavier, the burden of their unmet hopes lingering in your mind even as you walk away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3B" text="Overwhelmed by the emotional weight of the encounter, you quickly assert that you bear no responsibility for their financial woes. The atmosphere turns tense as you rise from your seat, ready to depart from the tavern. Their faces, a mix of shock and sadness, watch you as you stride out, leaving behind a silence filled with unspoken pleas and dashed hopes. The heaviness of the situation stays with you, a silent companion as you leave the tavern behind." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3C" text="Feeling unequipped to handle this situation, you firmly state that you owe them nothing. The family's expressions shift to one of disbelief as you get up, indicating your intent to leave. As you make your way out of the tavern, their forlorn looks linger in your mind, their unfulfilled expectations casting a shadow over your departure. The door closes behind you, but the echo of their plight resonates, leaving you with a sense of unresolved tension." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3D" text="Lacking the patience for such a confrontation, you dismissively tell them that they are not entitled to any compensation from you. The sorrow in their eyes deepens as you stand and head towards the tavern's exit. Their silent stares follow you, heavy with unmet needs and sorrow. As you step outside, the murmur of the tavern fades, but the imprint of their disappointed faces remains, a stark reminder of the encounter as you walk away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3E" text="Devoid of the energy to engage in this emotionally charged conversation, you tersely inform them of your inability to help. The family's expressions turn to a blend of grief and disbelief as you rise to leave. Walking out of the tavern, you can feel their eyes on your back, heavy with the weight of unfulfilled hopes. The door shuts behind you, but the heaviness of the moment lingers, casting a pall over your steps as you distance yourself from the tavern and their plight." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 4-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4A" text="Upon inquiring about the name and rank of the deceased soldier, you recognize him as the man you executed for treason. Curiously, you ask the family about the location of their farm, assuring them of your visit the next day. After politely excusing yourself, you leave the tavern. The next day, you and your men approach the farm with a sinister agenda. Rather than offering aid, you command your men to obliterate the farm and eliminate its inhabitants. Observing the chaos, you see your men forcefully escort the family outside, their hands bound. They then proceed to ransack the farmhouse, extracting valuables before setting it ablaze. You watch dispassionately as the farmhouse is engulfed in flames and your men carry out the execution of the entire family. After the grim task is completed, you signal your men to regroup and depart towards your main encampment. Back at camp, your men report that they acquired {goldLooted} gold from the looting, a cold testament to the day's ruthless actions." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4B" text="You inquire about the soldier's details. Recognizing his name, you recall his fate as a traitor executed by your command. Curious, you ask about their farm's location, promising to visit the next day. After excusing yourself, you leave the tavern. The next day, you arrive at their farm, not with aid, but a grim plan. You command your men to raze the farm and eliminate the family. As the flames engulf the farmhouse, you oversee the capture and execution of the family. Your men emerge with valuables, including {goldLooted} gold, which they report back at camp. The grim task completed, you return to your main party, the day's events leaving a stark mark on your memory." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4C" text="After learning the soldier's name, memories of his execution for treachery flood back. You feign interest in their farm's whereabouts, stating you'll visit soon. Politely excusing yourself, you exit the tavern. The following dawn, you and your men reach the farm, harboring dark intentions. You coldly order the destruction of the farm and the execution of its inhabitants. You stand watch as your men bind the family, pillage the house, and set it ablaze. The family's execution is carried out under your watchful eye. Your men later inform you at camp that they secured {goldLooted} gold from the looting." />

You oversee the operation as your men forcibly remove the family, loot their possessions, and execute them one by one. The farmhouse is reduced to ashes. Back at camp, your men report a loot of {goldLooted} gold from the raid." />

    <!--LightsInTheSkies - Event Part 1-->
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_1A" text="Late one night, you are taking a walk in the woods near {closestSettlement} to clear your head. You manage to find a nice clearing not too far into the woods where you sit down and lean against a big boulder to relax. As you sit there, you notice a light approaching in the sky from the south. You stand up and look at the light that now has come even closer. It's glowing and keeps changing colors, but it hovers in the sky without a sound. After you've stared at the light for a few minutes, it disappears over the treeline. Having no clue to what you witnessed, you make your way back but you are somewhat shocked when you see the sun is rising in the east, as by your calculations, it's just after midnight. You make haste back to the main camp. When you arrive, some of your high-ranking men run towards you and ask you where you have been. Perplexed, you answer them and tell them about the strange light. You are shocked when the men tell you that you have been gone for over 5 hours. A few hours later your party is on the move again, but the men can clearly notice that you are preoccupied with last night's events." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_1B" text="One evening, you decide to clear your head with a walk near {closestSettlement}. As you venture into the woods, you come across a peaceful clearing and rest against a large rock. While relaxing, you notice a light moving across the southern sky. Curious, you stand and watch as the light draws closer, glowing and shifting colors. It moves silently above the trees before vanishing into the distance. Time feels strange, and as you return to the main camp, you realize the sun is rising despite it feeling like midnight. Upon your arrival, your high-ranking men inform you that you've been missing for over 5 hours. The next day, you remain deeply unsettled, lost in thought over the night's events." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_1C" text="As the night grows late, you take a stroll near {closestSettlement} to gather your thoughts. A short walk into the woods leads you to a serene clearing. Leaning back against a boulder, you spot a peculiar light in the southern sky. It approaches slowly, pulsating and shifting hues without making a sound. The light hovers, then abruptly vanishes beyond the trees. Confused, you head back but are startled to see dawn breaking. When you return to camp, your men ask where you’ve been, claiming you’ve been gone for hours. Their words only deepen the mystery of the light you saw. The next day, the incident weighs heavily on your mind." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_1D" text="Taking a late-night walk to clear your thoughts, you wander near {closestSettlement} and find a clearing among the trees. While resting, you notice a distant light in the southern sky. It draws closer, glowing and shifting colors eerily in complete silence. You watch, entranced, as it moves over the treetops before disappearing. As you walk back, the rising sun catches you off guard—it feels far too early. Reaching the camp, your men confront you, claiming you've been missing for hours. Their revelation leaves you shaken, unable to comprehend what you experienced." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_1E" text="While walking through the woods near {closestSettlement} to clear your mind, you find a quiet clearing and sit against a large rock. A glowing light appears in the sky to the south, drawing closer. It pulses with shifting colors and moves silently above the trees before vanishing. Returning to camp, you are stunned to see the sun rising, as it feels like you were gone only moments. Your men approach, relieved to see you, and tell you that hours have passed. You can't shake the feeling of unease as you reflect on the strange encounter." />

    <!--LightsInTheSkies - Event Part 2-->
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_2A" text="When you finally decide to make camp for the night you go to wash yourself in your tent. While washing your face, you notice that you are bleeding from the nose. You attempt to blow your nose, only to find a small metallic-looking object come out. You pick it up and study it for a few seconds before it crumbles to ash before your eyes. You also notice several small, fresh scars on your extremities. They are identical and perfectly rounded, showing no signs of bleeding. To your horror, you discover that you are missing two molars, and the nails on your right foot are gone. This realization leaves you trembling with fear. As night falls, drifting to sleep alongside the last rays of daylight, you suddenly awaken drenched in sweat, heart pounding, and discover that you have wet the bed. Shaken, you reach for your diary to write down fragments of a dream that now seems all too vivid." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_2B" text="As you settle into camp for the night, you wash your face in your tent. Glancing into the basin, you notice blood dripping from your nose. Blowing your nose, a metallic object emerges, which disintegrates into ash when you pick it up. Confused and frightened, you inspect your body and discover fresh scars on your limbs—perfectly round, with no sign of bleeding. The terror deepens when you realize two of your molars are missing, along with the nails on your right foot. Falling asleep hours later, you are jolted awake, drenched in sweat and trembling. Your diary offers a faint solace as you try to record the fleeting remnants of a disturbing dream." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_2C" text="While preparing to rest in your tent, you notice a faint trickle of blood from your nose. As you blow your nose, a strange metallic object dislodges and crumbles to dust in your hand. Inspecting yourself, you find small, circular scars on your arms and legs—silent, bloodless, and uniform. Panic sets in when you discover missing molars and toenails. As you finally drift to sleep, exhaustion overtaking fear, you awaken hours later in a cold sweat, heart pounding. The fragments of a dream cling to your mind, compelling you to record them in your diary before they fade completely." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_2D" text="After setting up camp, you retreat to your tent to clean up. As you wash your face, a nosebleed starts. When you blow your nose, a metallic object emerges and crumbles into dust. Fear escalates as you examine your limbs and discover identical round scars. The realization that your molars and toenails are missing strikes like a lightning bolt, leaving you shaken. The night’s darkness deepens, and exhaustion eventually takes you to sleep. But you awaken drenched in sweat, your heart racing, with faint memories of a dream that you hastily jot down in your diary." />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_2E" text="As the camp settles for the night, you wash your face in the privacy of your tent. Noticing blood from your nose, you blow it and watch in horror as a metallic object falls out, disintegrating before you can examine it. Checking your body, you find strange, bloodless scars and horrifyingly discover missing teeth and toenails. Though fear consumes you, sleep eventually claims you. Hours later, you wake drenched in sweat, trembling as flashes of a vivid dream haunt you. Desperate to preserve what little you recall, you reach for your diary." />

    <!--LightsInTheSkies - Event Part 3-->
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_3A" text="“I am in the clearing at night, staring at the strange light, when suddenly an intense beam engulfs me, lifting me off the ground and pulling me toward the light. As I get closer, I realize the light is emanating from a silvery metallic object with an opening that draws me in. Overcome by terror, I lose consciousness.” “When I awaken, I am strapped to a cold metallic table, surrounded by three strange beings. They resemble humans in size and form, but their faces are covered in dense hair, while their ears and noses are oddly hairless.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_3B" text="“The clearing is bathed in the strange light, and before I can react, a beam of energy engulfs me, lifting me from the ground. I am pulled toward the source of the light, which reveals itself to be a silvery metallic object with an open entrance. Fear consumes me as I approach, and I pass out.” “When I regain consciousness, I am lying on a freezing metallic table. Three strange creatures stand nearby. They appear human-like but smaller, their faces obscured by thick hair except for their smooth, hairless ears and noses.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_3C" text="“In the clearing, the light intensifies and suddenly, a beam strikes me, lifting me effortlessly toward the sky. As I ascend, I see that the light comes from a silvery metal object with an opening drawing me in. Horror overtakes me, and I black out.” “When I come to, I am strapped to a cold, metallic table. Surrounding me are three beings, vaguely human-like but smaller. Their faces are covered in thick hair, yet their ears and noses are smooth and hairless, making them look even stranger.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_3D" text="“The strange light envelops me, and I am struck by a powerful beam that lifts me toward the source. As I draw closer, I see it is a silvery metallic object with an open portal. Fear takes hold as I am pulled closer, and everything fades to black.” “When I awaken, I find myself restrained on a cold metal table. Surrounding me are three odd creatures, humanoid in form but smaller, their faces hidden under thick hair, except for their oddly bare ears and noses.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_3E" text="“In the clearing, I am transfixed by the strange light, when without warning, a powerful beam hits me and lifts me off the ground. The source of the light reveals itself to be a metallic object, shining silver with an open entrance that draws me in. The sheer terror is too much, and I lose consciousness.” “When I open my eyes, I am lying on a frigid metallic table. Three figures stand around me, humanoid but smaller, their faces shrouded in thick hair. Strangely, their ears and noses are smooth and bare, adding to their uncanny appearance.”" />

    <!--LightsInTheSkies - Event Part 4-->
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_4A" text="“I lie there, paralyzed, as the creatures prod me with strange instruments and scribble notes, speaking in an incomprehensible language. After a while, they place a helmet over my head, and suddenly, a sequence of images and symbols is burned into my mind. The helmet is removed, and moments later, a mask is placed over my mouth and nose. Darkness consumes me as I pass out once again.” “When I regain consciousness, I find myself standing in the clearing, watching the light vanish beyond the treeline.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_4B" text="“Unable to move, I feel the creatures poke and prod me with instruments while they exchange words in an alien language. At some point, they place a helmet over my head, and my mind is flooded with a series of burning images and patterns. After removing the helmet, they cover my face with a mask. My vision fades, and I black out again.” “When I awaken, I am back in the clearing, staring at the strange light as it disappears into the night.”" />
    <string id="LightsInTheSkies_Event_Text_4C" text="“I am frozen in place as the beings prod me with various tools and appear to communicate in a language I cannot understand. A helmet is placed on my head, and a vivid, searing sequence is etched into my mind.

After a short while, you observe the object re-emerging from the forest and ascending into the sky at an astonishing speed. Eventually, only one of your men returns, appearing shaken. He tells you a bizarre story. Upon entering the forest, they encountered a mysterious object amidst the trees, which was emanating an intense heat and strange light. Suddenly, an opening appeared and three small figures, clad in unfamiliar, shining armor, stepped out. As one of your men moved to approach these entities, he was struck in the abdomen by a glowing projectile emitted from a small, futuristic weapon the entities wielded. He died almost instantly. The survivor, having concealed himself in dense undergrowth, witnessed the rest of the events unfold.

Curious, {soldiersInvestigating} of your men decide to investigate the mysterious occurrence, while you opt to stay at the camp. Not long after, the object swiftly leaves the forest, shooting towards the sky at a breathtaking velocity. Finally, only one of your soldiers returns, looking bewildered and alarmed. He shares a rather extraordinary tale with you. He explains that as they ventured into the forest, they discovered an object that was emitting both heat and a bright light. A hatch opened, revealing three small, oddly dressed figures in what seemed like advanced armor. One soldier, daring to get closer, was suddenly struck by a luminous arrow, launched from a peculiar, compact weapon carried by the figures. He collapsed, lifeless. The remaining soldier, who had prudently hidden behind some bushes, silently observed the subsequent actions of these beings. They methodically and coldly killed the remaining {killedSoldiers} soldiers. After their ruthless act, they quickly retreated to their vessel and disappeared into the sky." />

Moments later, you witness the object rapidly ascend from the forest canopy, vanishing into the sky at an incredible pace. Only one of your soldiers manages to return from the investigation, his expression one of shock and disbelief. He recounts a strange and unsettling encounter. He tells you that upon entering the forest, they stumbled upon an unusual object among the trees, which was radiating an extraordinary amount of heat and light. An aperture appeared on the object, and from it emerged three small figures, donning unfamiliar, reflective armor. When one of your men attempted to communicate or approach them, he was hit in the abdomen by a radiant arrow from a strange, small weapon they possessed, resulting in his immediate death. The surviving soldier, who had wisely taken cover in the thick underbrush, watched in horror as the alien figures proceeded to eliminate systematically the other {killedSoldiers} soldiers who had accompanied him. After their lethal mission, the beings retreated back into their craft and swiftly departed, leaving behind a trail of mystery and death." />

He recounts an eerie and unexpected experience. He describes how they came across a peculiar object hidden amongst the trees, emitting an intense heat and a piercing light. Abruptly, an entryway opened on the object, and out stepped three small figures in what appeared to be advanced, gleaming armor. When one brave soldier approached them, he was immediately struck down by a shining arrow shot from a compact, unknown weapon that the figures carried. He died instantly. The remaining soldier, having hidden himself among dense foliage, remained unseen and watched the unsettling events unfold. He observed the figures as they coldly and efficiently killed the rest of the {killedSoldiers} soldiers who had ventured into the forest. Completing their grim task, they returned to their vessel and left as quickly as they had arrived, leaving a sense of foreboding and fear in their wake." />

The soldier who returned from this ordeal was a trusted man whom you are inclined to believe. You tell him to go get some food and go to bed. As he is heading towards his tent, he suddenly bends over and starts vomiting violently. He then falls to the ground in agony while blood is flowing from all his facial orifices. You grab a sword and put him out of his misery and order your men to burn his body at once. When you return to your tent you are shaking.

As he heads to his tent, he suddenly doubles over, violently vomiting. Within moments, he collapses in excruciating pain, blood streaming from his eyes, nose, and mouth.

However, as he moves towards his tent, he suddenly starts to retch violently, then falls, blood oozing from his facial orifices. Acting quickly, you mercifully kill him with your sword and command your men to burn the body without delay. Back in your tent, you're visibly shaken.

Tragically, as he walks to his tent, he is overtaken by violent vomiting and collapses, blood pouring from every facial opening. You end his agony swiftly with your sword and order an immediate cremation of his body. Shaken, you return to your tent, struggling to process the day's events.

Or perhaps they're angels of our fallen ancestors watching over us. You have never shared these thoughts with anyone as most would think you to be crazy.

    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_2A" text="Gathering your courage, you manage to whisper a tentative 'hello' into the stillness of the night. In response, the ghostly woman emits a bone-chilling shriek, a sound so piercing and unearthly it seems to reverberate through the very fabric of the air. In an instant, she vanishes before your eyes, leaving behind a haunting echo of her cry. The sudden silence that follows is almost as terrifying as the scream itself. You find yourself paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. The rest of the night is spent in your bed, shaking uncontrollably, every shadow and rustle of the wind magnified into a thousand frightful possibilities. The image of her tormented face and the memory of her harrowing scream linger with you, ensuring that sleep remains an elusive, distant dream for the remainder of the night." />

The vision of her anguished face and the chilling sound of her cry haunt you, making sleep an impossible feat." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_2C" text="With hesitant bravery, you utter a soft 'hello' into the night's quiet. The ghostly figure responds with a scream that chills your bones, an unearthly howl vibrating through the atmosphere. In a blink, she's gone, her wail lingering in the air. Rooted to the spot in terror, you can't move or speak. The remainder of the night is a blur of fear, every minor noise or shadow appearing monstrous and threatening. Her pained expression and the memory of her eerie scream stay with you, banishing any hope of sleep." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_2D" text="Bracing yourself, you gently say 'hello' into the calm of the night. The ghost-like woman unleashes a scream so chilling and surreal it seems to shake the very air. Then, she's nowhere to be seen, her cry echoing hauntingly. Stricken with fear, you stand petrified, speechless. The rest of the night is a cascade of terror, with every little sound or movement becoming a source of unspeakable horror. Her tortured visage and the echoing scream remain etched in your mind, driving away any chance of sleep." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_2E" text="With a trembling voice, you breathe out a 'hello' into the still night.

You're left paralyzed with fear, unable to utter another word. The night turns into a long ordeal of terror, with every shadow and whisper of wind seeming ominous and full of dread. The image of her suffering face and her terrifying scream linger with you, ensuring a night devoid of sleep." />

    <!--SupernaturalEncounter - Event 3-->
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3A" text="Panicked as if chased by a horde of Sea Raiders, you leap from your bed, arms flailing, and bolt out the door like a shot arrow. Your mad sprint through the camp is a blur of tents and startled faces. As you skid to a halt by the campfire, you're a wild-eyed, breathless mess, hastily explaining about a ghostly apparition in your tent. Your men burst into uncontrollable laughter. One of them, a veteran with a scarred face, mimics your terrified expression, 'Did the ghost threaten to steal your boots?' he jests, while another, a younger recruit, starts a playful chant, 'Brave {heroName}, scared of the dark!' They laugh heartily, clinking their ale mugs, as you stand there, your fear slowly turning into a sheepish grin. The night continues with exaggerated reenactments of your 'brave escape,' your men finding endless amusement in your uncharacteristic dash." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3B" text="You catapult out of your bed as if a bandit lord was on your heels, your feet barely touching the ground in your frantic escape. The entire camp seems to whirl past as you sprint straight to the campfire. Gasping for air, you recount the terrifying encounter with what seemed like a ghost. The men fall into fits of laughter. 'Was the ghost armed? Did you win the duel?' one asks between chuckles. Another, a grizzled sergeant, pretends to be frightened by his shadow, sending the group into another uproar. Jokes about recruiting ghosts for your next siege or sending you on a 'ghost patrol' fill the air. As the night wears on, your tale of terror becomes a campfire legend, embellished with each retelling, much to the delight of your troops." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3C" text="With a shriek that echoes through the camp, you leap from your bed as if it were on fire and make a beeline for the door, sprinting as though leading a desperate charge against Swadian knights. You stumble into the campfire area, a mix of fear and confusion. Out of breath, you explain about a ghostly figure in your tent. The men erupt in laughter. One of them, a jester at heart, grabs a blanket and starts floating around, imitating your ghost. 'Look out, our commander will desert us for a ghost,' he cackles. Another pats your back, 'Don’t worry, we’ll stand guard tonight, lest the scary ghost returns!' he says with a wink. The rest of the evening is filled with light-hearted banter and mock ghost stories, each more outrageous than the last, as you join in the laughter, your initial fear dissolving into the warm camaraderie of your men." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3D" text="In a frenzy that rivals a villager escaping raiders, you jump from your bed and hurtle through the camp. Dodging tents and a snoozing hound, you arrive at the campfire, a picture of wide-eyed panic. Breathlessly, you recount your ghostly encounter, expecting some empathy. Instead, your comrades erupt with laughter. One jokes heartily, 'Scared more than a peasant at tax time!' while another breaks into a playful song about ghostly pursuits. The night turns into an uproar of jests and light-hearted teasing, suggestions of a ghost hunt adding to the merriment. As the fire crackles and stars shimmer, laughter fills the air, your spectral scare now a favorite tale among your fellow soldiers." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3E" text="Like a deer startled by an arrow, you bound from your bed and race through the camp with the speed of a fleeing looter. Your dramatic entrance at the campfire, where your men lounge leisurely, is met with surprise. Out of breath, you recount your ghostly encounter, expecting a mix of awe and concern. Instead, your men can't hold back their laughter. A gruff soldier knight jests, 'Did you challenge the ghost to a duel, or were you too busy running?' Another playfully peers into the darkness, pretending to spot a whole army of ghosts. The mood lightens as they tease you about enlisting ghosts for your next campaign. Amidst chuckles and friendly jibes, your eerie experience turns into a source of mirth, bringing a light-hearted end to the evening under the starlit Calradian sky." />

    <!--SupernaturalEncounter - Event 4-->
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_4A" text="As the first light of dawn filters through your tent, you stir awake, feeling unusually refreshed.

As you prepare for the day, there's a newfound lightness in your step, the worries of the night dissolved in the morning's gentle embrace." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_4B" text="You awaken to the morning sun casting gentle rays across your bedding, a sense of deep restfulness enveloping you.

You sit up, feeling rejuvenated, the ghostly visitation now nothing more than a shadow, lost in the recesses of your mind. As you step out of your tent, the fresh air fills your lungs, and you find yourself smiling, ready to face the new day with vigor, the night's fears locked away in the vault of forgotten dreams." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_4C" text="You open your eyes to the soft glow of dawn, feeling an unexpected sense of peace. The frightful encounter with the ghostly apparition that had haunted your night seems strangely absent from your thoughts. It's as if the morning light has washed away the remnants of fear, leaving behind a clear, tranquil mind. You rise, feeling lighter and more composed than you have in days. The memory of the night's specter now feels like a distant, untroubling thought, barely a whisper in the back of your mind as you prepare to greet the day with renewed energy and a clear head." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_4D" text="As the morning sun peeks through the fabric of your tent, you wake up feeling surprisingly well-rested. The harrowing events of the night, which had once seemed so vivid and terrifying, now feel like they never happened. It's as though the light of day has a power to erase the fears of the dark. You stretch, feeling revitalized, the memory of the ghostly figure fading like mist in the morning sun. With a light heart, you step outside, ready to embrace the day's challenges, the echoes of the night's terror now just a fleeting, inconsequential memory." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_4E" text="The chirping of birds outside your tent gently coaxes you from sleep, and you awaken to a morning bathed in soft, golden light. Remarkably, you feel thoroughly rested, the turmoil of the previous night's ghostly encounter seemingly erased from your consciousness. It's as if the night's shadows, which had once loomed so large and menacing, have been dispelled by the reassuring light of day. You lie there for a moment, basking in the serene quiet, the memory of the spectral visitor now fading like a half-remembered dream. As you rise to greet the day, there's a spring in your step, a sense of liberation from the night's fright, as if it were a tale from a distant past, no longer holding any sway over your thoughts or emotions." />

A young maiden comes to your side and begins counting down. \n\nThree!  Two!  One!  Drink! \n\nThe boy raises his mug quickly and begins chugging as fast as he can, while you just stand there smiling, looking around. You can hear your men laughing in the background as you boast your lack of urgency. When the boy is about half way finished you finally take your mug and begin drinking. Within seconds you slam the mug back on the table, empty. The young man realizes you have already finished and gasps for air. His cheeks turn red as the whole tavern erupts in laughter. You see the shame in his eyes, so you grab his hand and raise it to the air, ensuring no hard feelings as you buy him another drink." />

Drinks are overflowing, hunger is satiated, and some troops have started games such as arm wrestling and cards. Everything seems perfect until your stomach begins to churn, and a commotion erupts on the far side of the camp.&#xA;&#xA;Your men are doubled over in pain, some vomiting uncontrollably, others writhing on the ground in agony. A sinking realization hits you—you've been poisoned. Panic sets in as questions swirl in your mind: Who did this? Why? But soon your thoughts blur, and darkness edges into your vision. The last thing you see are motionless bodies among your men. You can only hope the poison won't claim more lives." />
    <string id="PoisonedWine_Event_Text_B" text="As night falls, you throw a lively party to lift your men’s spirits. The camp buzzes with activity—drinks flow, food is devoured, and cheers ring out from games of skill and chance. Just when you think the night couldn't be better, a wave of nausea grips you, and cries of distress erupt from the crowd.&#xA;&#xA;Your men are collapsing, clutching their stomachs, some unable to stop vomiting. The realization hits hard: the wine is poisoned. As the chaos spreads, your head spins with questions and fear. Before you lose consciousness, you catch a glimpse of lifeless figures scattered across the ground. You pray the rest of your men will survive." />
