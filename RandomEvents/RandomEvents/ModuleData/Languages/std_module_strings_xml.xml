    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 1-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1A" text="You ask for the name and rank of the man who died. When she tells you his name you do remember him and how he died. The soldier in question was executed by your hands as it was discovered he was a traitor. The question you ask yourself now is if his entire family should suffer from his mistake. They have spoken so warmly about him that you don't want to tell them the truth about how he died so you make up a heroic story. Even though the family have no right for compensation, you agree to pay them {familyCompensation} gold in compensation so they can keep their family farm. After you have handed over the gold to them and they have left, you cannot help but wonder if you did the right thing keeping the mother in the dark about her son's true nature. You end up drinking the night away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1B" text="You inquire about the name and rank of the deceased soldier. Upon hearing his name, you recall him vividly – he was executed by your order for treason. Now, you're faced with a moral dilemma: should his family suffer for his betrayal? They speak of him with such fondness that you decide against revealing the bitter truth, instead, crafting a tale of his bravery. Though they aren't entitled to compensation, you choose to give them {familyCompensation} gold to support their farm. As they depart with the gold, you're left questioning whether keeping the mother uninformed of her son's betrayal was the right choice. The rest of your night is spent in contemplative drinking, pondering over the complexities of truth and compassion." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1C" text="You request the name and details of the soldier who lost his life. Recognizing the name, you remember his fate - he was a traitor whom you had to execute. This revelation leaves you in a quandary; does his family deserve to bear the consequences of his actions? They hold him in such high regard that you choose not to shatter their image of him, instead telling a story of his heroism. Though they have no legal claim to compensation, you feel compelled to offer them {familyCompensation} gold to save their farm. After they leave with the money, doubts linger about your decision to keep the truth hidden, leading you to seek solace in drink as you reflect on the night's events." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1D" text="You question the woman about her husband's identity and his role in your army. When she mentions his name, it strikes a chord – he was the soldier you had executed for committing treason. This knowledge presents a difficult choice: should his family suffer for his wrongdoing? Realizing they hold him in high esteem, you decide to spare them the painful truth, inventing a story of his gallantry instead. Although there's no obligation for compensation, you hand them {familyCompensation} gold to help maintain their farm. After they've gone, you're left with a heavy heart, wondering if keeping the mother oblivious to her son's real actions was just. The night passes in a blur as you drink away your uncertainties." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_1E" text="Curiously, you ask about the soldier's identity. When she reveals his name, memories flood back – he was the one you had to execute for his treacherous acts. This recollection forces you to confront a tough decision: is it fair for his family to pay for his mistake? Given their affectionate memories of him, you opt not to disclose the harsh reality, instead weaving a narrative of his valor. Despite no entitlement to compensation, you feel morally obliged to provide them {familyCompensation} gold for their farm's upkeep. Once they leave with the gold, a sense of doubt creeps in about your choice to conceal the truth from his mother, leading you to drown these thoughts in alcohol as the night progresses." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 2-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2A" text="You ask for the name and rank of the man who died. When she tells you his name you do remember him and how he died. The soldier in question was executed by your hands as it was discovered he was a traitor. You tell the family that you cannot grant them compensation as it was specified in his contract that the family left behind had no right to claim compensation. The woman starts to cry and begs you to help them. You decline to help them and leave the tavern." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2B" text="You inquire about the fallen soldier's name and rank. Recognition dawns as his name is mentioned, along with the memory of his execution - a traitor's end by your own hand. You inform the family that compensation is not possible, as his military contract clearly stated no entitlement for his family in such circumstances. The woman breaks down in tears, pleading for your assistance. Despite her pleas, you firmly uphold the decision and exit the tavern, leaving the family to grapple with the harsh realities of their situation." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2C" text="Seeking details, you ask about the soldier's identity. His name triggers memories; he was the one you executed for betrayal. You explain to the family that, according to his service terms, they are ineligible for compensation. Overwhelmed with sorrow, the woman starts to weep and implores you for aid. However, bound by the rules of the contract, you choose not to intervene and make your way out of the tavern, leaving them in their moment of despair." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2D" text="You question the family about the soldier's name and service rank. Upon hearing his name, you recall his fate – a traitor executed under your command. You relay to the family that, as per his agreement, they have no right to compensation. The woman's tears start to flow as she desperately seeks your help. Despite her distress, you maintain your stance, unable to deviate from the contract's stipulations, and depart from the tavern, leaving the family in their sorrowful state." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_2E" text="Curious, you ask for the soldier's identity. His name brings back the memory of his execution for treachery. You inform the family that, under the terms of his enlistment, they are not entitled to any compensation. The woman, stricken with grief, begins to cry and earnestly requests your help. Despite her emotional plea, you stand by the contract's terms, declining to provide assistance, and take your leave from the tavern, immersed in the complexity of duty and compassion." />

The weight of their gaze lingers on you as you stand up, signaling your desire to leave the tavern. Their faces, etched with disappointment and growing despair, fade into the background as you step out, seeking to distance yourself from the situation. As you exit, the air of the tavern suddenly feels heavier, the burden of their unmet hopes lingering in your mind even as you walk away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3B" text="Overwhelmed by the emotional weight of the encounter, you quickly assert that you bear no responsibility for their financial woes. The atmosphere turns tense as you rise from your seat, ready to depart from the tavern. Their faces, a mix of shock and sadness, watch you as you stride out, leaving behind a silence filled with unspoken pleas and dashed hopes. The heaviness of the situation stays with you, a silent companion as you leave the tavern behind." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3C" text="Feeling unequipped to handle this situation, you firmly state that you owe them nothing. The family's expressions shift to one of disbelief as you get up, indicating your intent to leave. As you make your way out of the tavern, their forlorn looks linger in your mind, their unfulfilled expectations casting a shadow over your departure. The door closes behind you, but the echo of their plight resonates, leaving you with a sense of unresolved tension." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3D" text="Lacking the patience for such a confrontation, you dismissively tell them that they are not entitled to any compensation from you. The sorrow in their eyes deepens as you stand and head towards the tavern's exit. Their silent stares follow you, heavy with unmet needs and sorrow. As you step outside, the murmur of the tavern fades, but the imprint of their disappointed faces remains, a stark reminder of the encounter as you walk away." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_3E" text="Devoid of the energy to engage in this emotionally charged conversation, you tersely inform them of your inability to help. The family's expressions turn to a blend of grief and disbelief as you rise to leave. Walking out of the tavern, you can feel their eyes on your back, heavy with the weight of unfulfilled hopes. The door shuts behind you, but the heaviness of the moment lingers, casting a pall over your steps as you distance yourself from the tavern and their plight." />

    <!--FallenSoldier - Event 4-->
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4A" text="Upon inquiring about the name and rank of the deceased soldier, you recognize him as the man you executed for treason. Curiously, you ask the family about the location of their farm, assuring them of your visit the next day. After politely excusing yourself, you leave the tavern. The next day, you and your men approach the farm with a sinister agenda. Rather than offering aid, you command your men to obliterate the farm and eliminate its inhabitants. Observing the chaos, you see your men forcefully escort the family outside, their hands bound. They then proceed to ransack the farmhouse, extracting valuables before setting it ablaze. You watch dispassionately as the farmhouse is engulfed in flames and your men carry out the execution of the entire family. After the grim task is completed, you signal your men to regroup and depart towards your main encampment. Back at camp, your men report that they acquired {goldLooted} gold from the looting, a cold testament to the day's ruthless actions." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4B" text="You inquire about the soldier's details. Recognizing his name, you recall his fate as a traitor executed by your command.

You command your men to raze the farm and eliminate the family. As the flames engulf the farmhouse, you oversee the capture and execution of the family. Your men emerge with valuables, including {goldLooted} gold, which they report back at camp. The grim task completed, you return to your main party, the day's events leaving a stark mark on your memory." />

You feign interest in their farm's whereabouts, stating you'll visit soon. Politely excusing yourself, you exit the tavern. The following dawn, you and your men reach the farm, harboring dark intentions. You coldly order the destruction of the farm and the execution of its inhabitants. You stand watch as your men bind the family, pillage the house, and set it ablaze. The family's execution is carried out under your watchful eye. Your men later inform you at camp that they secured {goldLooted} gold from the looting." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4D" text="Recognizing the name of the soldier you executed for betrayal, you express interest in visiting their farm. You leave the tavern, promising to arrive the next day. Upon arrival at the farm, your intentions are far from benevolent.

You oversee the operation as your men forcibly remove the family, loot their possessions, and execute them one by one. The farmhouse is reduced to ashes. Back at camp, your men report a loot of {goldLooted} gold from the raid." />
    <string id="FallenSoldier_Event_Choice_4E" text="Upon hearing the soldier's name, you remember executing him for treason.

After a short while, you observe the object re-emerging from the forest and ascending into the sky at an astonishing speed. Eventually, only one of your men returns, appearing shaken. He tells you a bizarre story. Upon entering the forest, they encountered a mysterious object amidst the trees, which was emanating an intense heat and strange light. Suddenly, an opening appeared and three small figures, clad in unfamiliar, shining armor, stepped out. As one of your men moved to approach these entities, he was struck in the abdomen by a glowing projectile emitted from a small, futuristic weapon the entities wielded. He died almost instantly. The survivor, having concealed himself in dense undergrowth, witnessed the rest of the events unfold. He recounts that the entities then proceeded to methodically eliminate the other {killedSoldiers} soldiers.

Not long after, the object swiftly leaves the forest, shooting towards the sky at a breathtaking velocity. Finally, only one of your soldiers returns, looking bewildered and alarmed. He shares a rather extraordinary tale with you. He explains that as they ventured into the forest, they discovered an object that was emitting both heat and a bright light. A hatch opened, revealing three small, oddly dressed figures in what seemed like advanced armor. One soldier, daring to get closer, was suddenly struck by a luminous arrow, launched from a peculiar, compact weapon carried by the figures. He collapsed, lifeless. The remaining soldier, who had prudently hidden behind some bushes, silently observed the subsequent actions of these beings. They methodically and coldly killed the remaining {killedSoldiers} soldiers. After their ruthless act, they quickly retreated to their vessel and disappeared into the sky." />

Moments later, you witness the object rapidly ascend from the forest canopy, vanishing into the sky at an incredible pace. Only one of your soldiers manages to return from the investigation, his expression one of shock and disbelief. He recounts a strange and unsettling encounter. He tells you that upon entering the forest, they stumbled upon an unusual object among the trees, which was radiating an extraordinary amount of heat and light. An aperture appeared on the object, and from it emerged three small figures, donning unfamiliar, reflective armor. When one of your men attempted to communicate or approach them, he was hit in the abdomen by a radiant arrow from a strange, small weapon they possessed, resulting in his immediate death. The surviving soldier, who had wisely taken cover in the thick underbrush, watched in horror as the alien figures proceeded to eliminate systematically the other {killedSoldiers} soldiers who had accompanied him. After their lethal mission, the beings retreated back into their craft and swiftly departed, leaving behind a trail of mystery and death." />
    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_1E" text="In the vicinity of {closestSettlement}, your party pauses as an unidentifiable object makes its descent into the neighboring forest. Driven by curiosity, {soldiersInvestigating} of your men set out to explore the source of this unusual occurrence, while you choose to remain at the campsite. Shortly thereafter, the object is seen hastily exiting the forest, soaring into the sky at an incredible rate. Only one of your men makes it back, visibly disturbed and anxious. He recounts an eerie and unexpected experience. He describes how they came across a peculiar object hidden amongst the trees, emitting an intense heat and a piercing light. Abruptly, an entryway opened on the object, and out stepped three small figures in what appeared to be advanced, gleaming armor. When one brave soldier approached them, he was immediately struck down by a shining arrow shot from a compact, unknown weapon that the figures carried. He died instantly. The remaining soldier, having hidden himself among dense foliage, remained unseen and watched the unsettling events unfold. He observed the figures as they coldly and efficiently killed the rest of the {killedSoldiers} soldiers who had ventured into the forest. Completing their grim task, they returned to their vessel and left as quickly as they had arrived, leaving a sense of foreboding and fear in their wake." />

    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_2A" text="These creatures then proceeded to load the bodies of the soldiers into the vessel while speaking a language unlike anything ever heard before. They also seemed to load up pieces of the nearby flora as if taking samples for study. After a few minutes, the vessel leaves without a sound towards the sky. The soldier who returned from this ordeal was a trusted man whom you are inclined to believe. You tell him to go get some food and go to bed. As he is heading towards his tent, he suddenly bends over and starts vomiting violently. He then falls to the ground in agony while blood is flowing from all his facial orifices. You grab a sword and put him out of his misery and order your men to burn his body at once. When you return to your tent you are shaking. You try to make a note of this event in your diary but you find yourself too distraught to write anything. You ponder the question of who or what could have killed your men like this. The answer may never be known." />
    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_2B" text="The mysterious beings began methodically loading the fallen soldiers' bodies onto their craft, all the while conversing in an unintelligible, alien language. They appeared to be collecting samples of the local plants too, perhaps for some unknown research. Minutes later, the vessel ascended silently into the sky and vanished. The surviving soldier, a reliable and trusted member of your team, seemed genuinely shaken. Believing his account, you instruct him to eat and rest. As he heads to his tent, he suddenly doubles over, violently vomiting. Within moments, he collapses in excruciating pain, blood streaming from his eyes, nose, and mouth. You swiftly end his suffering with your sword and order an immediate cremation of his body. Returning to your tent, a sense of dread overwhelms you. You attempt to document the harrowing incident in your diary, but find yourself too unsettled to write coherently. The thought of what entity could have inflicted such horror upon your men lingers hauntingly in your mind, a question that might remain forever unanswered." />
    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_2C" text="The alien figures efficiently transferred the soldiers' corpses into their vessel, speaking in a bizarre, unheard language. They also gathered samples of the forest's vegetation, suggesting scientific interest. Shortly, the craft lifted off noiselessly into the sky. The returned soldier, known for his honesty, was visibly distressed. Trusting his testimony, you advise him to eat and sleep. However, as he moves towards his tent, he suddenly starts to retch violently, then falls, blood oozing from his facial orifices. Acting quickly, you mercifully kill him with your sword and command your men to burn the body without delay. Back in your tent, you're visibly shaken. Trying to record the event in your diary proves futile, as you're too disturbed. The identity of your men's killer and the nature of the attack plague your thoughts, a mystery that might never be solved." />
    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_2D" text="The strange creatures proceeded to load the deceased soldiers into their ship, speaking a language that defied comprehension. They also seemed to collect various plant specimens, likely for analysis. After completing their eerie task, the vessel ascended silently into the heavens. The soldier who returned, usually steadfast and believable, was clearly traumatized. Accepting his account, you tell him to rest and eat. Tragically, as he walks to his tent, he is overtaken by violent vomiting and collapses, blood pouring from every facial opening. You end his agony swiftly with your sword and order an immediate cremation of his body. Shaken, you return to your tent, struggling to process the day's events. You open your diary to document the occurrence but find yourself too distraught. The question of what could have annihilated your men in such a manner lingers ominously, likely remaining an unsolved enigma." />
    <string id="NotOfThisWorld_Part_2E" text="The entities began to transport the soldiers' bodies into their spacecraft, communicating in an alien dialect that was completely foreign. They also appeared to be collecting samples of the local flora, possibly for analysis. Within minutes, the vessel departed silently skyward. The soldier who made it back, known for his reliability, was visibly shaken by the experience. Taking his word, you suggest he get some food and rest. However, as he staggers to his tent, he is suddenly struck by violent vomiting, collapsing in pain as blood flows from his face. With a heavy heart, you end his suffering with your sword and order a prompt cremation. You return to your tent, trembling from the ordeal. Attempting to note down the event in your diary, you find yourself too distraught to write. The question of what force could have decimated your men in such a way haunts you, a mystery that might forever remain unsolved." />

    <string id="PassingComet_Event_Text_A" text="You and some of your men are standing in a field at night gazing up at a comet. It is one of the most beautiful sights you have ever seen. You cannot help wondering what it really is. You have always been fascinated by the stars and night sky. Most people believe it's the gods looking down on us, but you think otherwise.\n\nYou have often wondered if the stars are the same thing as the Sun just much further away... Or perhaps they're angels of our fallen ancestors watching over us. You have never shared these thoughts with anyone as most would think you to be crazy. At least for now you can be fascinated by the amazing comet passing by. You and a couple of your men end up standing there all night looking up and talking." />
    <string id="PassingComet_Event_Text_B" text="You find yourself with a few of your men in a quiet field, staring up at a comet streaking across the night sky. Its beauty is mesmerizing, filling you with wonder. You ponder its nature—could it be a message from the gods, as some believe, or something entirely different?\n\nThe stars have always fascinated you. Are they distant suns, like your own, or perhaps the spirits of those who came before us? Such thoughts linger in your mind, though you keep them to yourself. For now, you simply enjoy the sight of the comet, talking quietly with your men through the night." />
    <string id="PassingComet_Event_Text_C" text="Standing with some of your men in a dark field, you look up to see a comet cutting across the night sky. Its brilliance captivates you, sparking questions about its origin. Some say it’s the gods showing their presence, but you have other theories.\n\nCould the stars be suns, farther than you could ever imagine? Or are they the spirits of those who have left this world? You keep your musings private, fearing ridicule, but in this moment, you feel a deep connection to the heavens. You and your men stay in the field, marveling at the celestial display and sharing quiet conversations." />
    <string id="PassingComet_Event_Text_D" text="You stand with a few of your men under the vast night sky, captivated by a brilliant comet streaking overhead. It feels otherworldly, and you find yourself wondering what it really is. The stars have always been a source of fascination for you. Some believe they are the watchful eyes of gods, but you suspect otherwise.\n\nCould the stars be distant suns? Or perhaps they are the souls of those who once lived? These thoughts have always stayed with you, unspoken, but now, under the comet's light, you feel the vastness of the cosmos. You and your men remain there all night, gazing and talking in hushed tones." />
    <string id="PassingComet_Event_Text_E" text="In the stillness of the night, you and a small group of your men watch a comet blaze across the heavens. Its beauty is breathtaking, igniting your curiosity about the stars. Some see them as the eyes of gods, but your mind wanders to other possibilities.\n\nCould the stars be suns, unimaginably far away? Or are they the spirits of those who came before? You’ve often wondered but never voiced these thoughts, fearing how others might react. Tonight, though, the comet provides a moment of awe and reflection. You and your men stand together, quietly talking and marveling at the wonders of the night sky." />

Some of your men, inspired or desperate, join you in prayer.\n\nAfter nearly 10 minutes, it dawns on you that prayer alone might not suffice. You order your men to hand over {goldLostToReligion} gold to take to the nearest chapel.

Riding recklessly, your horse jumps a fence, causing you to fall and black out.\nYou wake to the dawn’s light and return to camp. Only then does the memory of the lost gold return to you, deepening your regret." />

In your haste, your horse leaps a fence, throwing you off and rendering you unconscious.\nWhen you awaken, the sun is already high in the sky.

    <string id="RedMoon_Event_Choice_1E" text="You collapse to your knees in desperation, praying loudly to the gods for mercy. Several of your men join you, seeking solace in prayer.\n\nWhen it becomes clear this won’t resolve anything, you collect {goldLostToReligion} gold and set off for {closestSettlement}, hoping the priests can help. Riding recklessly, your horse stumbles while jumping a fence, throwing you violently to the ground. You lose consciousness.\nAwakening at dawn, you slowly make your way back to camp.

You manage to find a nice clearing not to far into the woods where you sit down and lean against a big boulder to relax. As you sit there you notice there is a light approaching in the sky from the south. You stand up and look at the light that now has come even closer.

You make haste back to the main camp.\nWhen you arrive some of your high ranking men run towards you and asks you where you have been. Perplexed, you answer them and tell them about the strange light. You are shocked when the men tell you that you have been gone for over 5 hours.\n\nA few hours later your party is on the move again but the men can clearly notice that you are preoccupied with last nights events." />

They are small, and all are identical, perfectly rounded with no signs of bleeding from the wounds. You are even more shocked when you realize that you are, in fact, missing two of your molars and the nails on your right foot are gone. This event now has you scared senseless.\n\nAs night falls, and you drifting to sleep along with the last remnants of daylight you suddenly awaken, drenched in sweat, heart beating fast and you also notice that you have wet the bed.

I faint from horror.”\n\n“When I regain consciousness, I find myself strapped to a cold metallic table and I notice that I am surrounded by three strange creatures. These creatures look somewhat like humans, except from the fact they are somewhat smaller and their faces are covered in thick hair. Their ears and noses are for some reason hairless.”\n\n“I lie there unable to move as the creatures poke me with several instruments and take notes, all while I can hear their unrecognizable language.
